    <h3>TMD 20-Year Master Plan</h3>
    <div class="cols_12-3 first-col hasHeight"> </div>
    <div class="cols_12-9"> To guide the long-term success of San Diego’s tourism economy, the TMD has developed a 20-year master plan with input from nearly 200 community stakeholders across the public and private sector.  This bold undertaking comes at a critical time in San Diego’s tourism industry.  Over the past five years, competitive destinations have invested heavily in new product development, air access and brand marketing.  And the competitive pressure is intensifying as Universal Studios Hollywood launches their $1.6 billion capital investment, Disneyland plans its $1 billion Star Wars Land attraction and numerous convention centers expand.  The 20-year master plan seeks to address issues and opportunities around 4 key themes facing San Diego: Transportation, MICE, Brand Development and Leisure Asset Development.  In the year ahead, the SDTA staff and board look forward to working closely with the TMD to deploy against the master plan. </div>

    <h3>Global Promotion</h3>
    <div class="cols_12-3 first-col hasHeight"> </div>
    <div class="cols_12-9"> International travelers are highly desirable as they stay longer and spend more than domestic travelers.  In 2015, the U.S. Travel Association projects that international travel will grow to over 75 million.  California is one of the nation’s top states for international travelers and San Diego is the 11th most visited city.<br>
<br>


In 2015, the TMD increased the SDTA’s international marketing budget in order to better capitalize on this highly lucrative and growing market segment.  As a result, the SDTA now targets 6 priority international markets with trade representation, public relations, social media, and consumer direct marketing.  The countries are: Canada, United Kingdom, Mexico, China, Japan and Australia.  The SDTA has grown co-operative partnerships with Brand USA, Visit California and travel partners in country in order to increase exposure and expand San Diego’s global footprint.

    <h3>Business Identity</h3>
    <div class="cols_12-3 first-col hasHeight"> </div>
    <div class="cols_12-9"> Over the past five years, the SDTA has built a strong partnership with the San Diego Regional Economic Development Corporation to grow awareness of San Diego’s business culture. In the highly competitive meetings and convention market, a destination’s business reputation is now a key consideration of whether to hold an event there or not. To grow San Diego’s corporate business travel segment, a thriving business community is essential. San Diego has an appealing business culture that is shaped by the climate and lifestyle. This culture has fueled a business community that is entrepreneurial, collaborative and inspired. The SDTA and EDC plan to continue working together to share San Diego’s compelling business identity with the world thus extending the National Geographic Channel “World’s Smart Cities: San Diego” story.
